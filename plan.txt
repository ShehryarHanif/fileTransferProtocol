Modules/Parts Needed for Server:

---- Convert fork to connect **
b) Reading and disecting user input  **
c) User Authentication module**

Modules/Parts Needed for Server:
a) Connection Creation/Handling (the core component) **
---- Receiving FTP files **
b) Reading and disecting user input **
c) Commands Modules (for ! commands) and Command Handler **

Extra TODOs:
- Free all malloc memory
- Check all strtok
- Should we just disallow any CWD with a "/"
--- realpath()
- close ftp_client_connection properly alongside return statements
- Remove strcpy(state->msg, ...) in the forking sections
- Size limit of INT is approximately 2 GB


Questions:
- Is file transfer blocking for both server and client?
- How to decide client ports from N to N+i since they will likely overlap?
--- Local system
- Can client use "PORT" command directly?


Errnos:
- EACCES 13
- EADDRNOTAVAIL 98
