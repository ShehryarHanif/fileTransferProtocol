Modules/Parts Needed for Server:
a) Connection Creation/Handling (the core component)
---- Convert fork to connect **
b) Reading and disecting user input  **
c) User Authentication module**
d) Command Handler and Commands Modules **
f) Data transfer part/module**

Modules/Parts Needed for Server:
a) Connection Creation/Handling (the core component) **
---- Receiving FTP files **
b) Reading and disecting user input **
c) Commands Modules (for ! commands) and Command Handler **

Extra TODOs:
- close ftp_client_connection properly alongside return statements
- Remove strcpy(state->msg, ...) in the forking sections
- CWD for client


BUGS:
- Sending -1 somewhere?
- PORT when not authenticated ????
- \n on !CWD wrong folder
- CWD code??
- STOR/RETR when file does not exist
- LIST, PWD commands ignore extra params

Documentation:
- Size limit of INT is approximately 2 GB


Questions:
- Is file transfer blocking for both server and client?
- How to decide client ports from N to N+i since they will likely overlap?
--- Local system
- Can client use "PORT" command directly?


Errnos:
- EACCES 13
- EADDRNOTAVAIL 98
- EADDRINUSE 99
