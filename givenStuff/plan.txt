PLAN:

1. Implement User Authentication System using users.txt
--- Probably just create structs to store users and then store all users in array
--- Or whenver user logins, scan through file
--- Both works ig

2. Decide on structure of file
--- A lot of complex functions at work here
--- Need to neatly compartmentalize them

Modules/Parts Needed for Server:
a) Connection Creation/Handling (the core component)c
b) Reading and disecting user input
c) User Authentication module
d) Command Handler
e) Commands Modules
f) Data transfer part/module

d) Command Handler

3. Each data file transfer is done on a different port -> Select/Fork every time
